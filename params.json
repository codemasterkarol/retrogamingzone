My personal collection of old school consoles includes an Intellivision II, Atari 2600 and 7800, NES, SNES, N64, Sega Master System, and Playstation I & II. \r\n\r\nSometimes I come across cheap console games for old systems, and figured it would be awesome to have a place to keep track of my collection and items on my wishlist. So I created this site.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n- User registration / authentication system\r\n- User dashboard complete with collection and wishlist functionality\r\n- Gamification feature: leaderboard for who has the most items in their collection\r\n- Game and console database complete with cover art\r\n\r\n## Technology\r\nThis was my first Object Oriented PHP application. It was my first time for a lot of stuff.\r\nThat said: the code __SUCKS__. I mean it's really, *really* __bad__. Needs a full rewrite. So please don't judge me by this. This is public on github as a means to show how far I've come and how much I continue to grow.\r\n\r\n### Development\r\nThis project was built using the [SimpleMVC (Now known as Nova) PHP Framework](http://novaframework.com/php-framework)\r\n\r\n### Languages Used\r\n- HTML\r\n- CSS\r\n- Object Oriented PHP\r\n- JavaScript / AJAX\r\n\r\n### Frameworks / Libraries Used\r\n- Foundation CSS\r\n- Normalize\r\n- Modernizr\r\n- Font Awesome icons\r\n- jQuery\r\n- jQuery UI\r\n- Google reCaptcha\r\n- Google Fonts\r\n- Basically a lot of crap I did NOT need but was a requirement for the project at the time (as this was a midterm and final project for a college PHP course)\r\n\r\n### Database Schema\r\n![Retro Gaming Zone Database Schema](https://github.com/codemasterkarol/retrogamingzone/blob/master/Database_Schema_RGZ.png)\r\n*Note: This was my first attempt at designing and normalizing a database schema.*\r\n",
